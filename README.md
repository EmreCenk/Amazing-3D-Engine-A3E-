# Amazing-3D-Engine-A3E-
A 3d GraphÄ±cs Engine 

The coordinate system initially takes the camera as the origin (0,0,0).

In the initial camera configuration, the depth is the Z axis, left to right is the X axis and up/down is the Y axis. 

The Engine supports .obj files.
This means that you can import any 3d model that you create in blender. All you need to do this
 export -> export as .obj.
Before exporting, inside the geometry settings,  uncheck all of the boxes except "Triangulate Faces".
